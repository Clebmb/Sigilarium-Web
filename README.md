## 🌀 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (HOW TO OPERATE)

### 1. THE SOURCE OF POWER (INPUT MODES)
The ritual begins with the crystallization of intent. Choose your medium:
*   **TEXT**: The classic method. Type your statement of intent. The system extracts the geometric essence from the characters.
*   **NUM**: Direct gematria. Input sequences of numbers to define the sigil's primary nodes.
*   **DRAW**: Direct neural-link. Use your cursor or finger to trace original patterns onto the digital canvas.
*   **IMG**: Visual divination. Upload an image; the system will sample its luminosity patterns to generate a corresponding number sequence.

### 2. THE GEOMETRIC MATRIX
Modify the structural reality of your sigil:
*   **SEGMENTS**: Control the kaleidoscopic repetition (1-16 segments).
*   **GRID SYSTEMS**: 
    *   *Saturn*: A rigid 3x3 planetary square for stability.
    *   *Witch Wheel*: A circular expansion for fluid energy.
    *   *Chaos Scatter*: Entropic distribution for unpredictability.
*   **SYMMETRY**: Enable X and Y axis mirroring to create complex, balanced talismans.

### 3. TEMPORAL EBB (ANIMATIONS)
Infuse your sigil with "Life Force" through rhythmic cycles:
*   **Segment Draw**: Watch the sigil etch itself into reality frame-by-frame.
*   **Line Flow**: A pulse of light that travels through the geometric path.
*   **Rotational Force**: Clockwise or Counter-clockwise spinning to focus or release energy.
*   **Pulse / Breathe**: A rhythmic expansion and contraction of the sigil's glow.
*   **Chroma Spectrum**: Continuous shifting through the visible color frequencies.

## 🧪 THE SIGIL SCRIBE (SUBSYSTEM)
A built-in ritual assistant that automates the classical reduction methods of Austin Osman Spare:
1.  **Unique Character Extraction**: Filters out repetitive noise.
2.  **Consonant Reduction**: Strips the "vocal soul" (vowels) to reach the skeletal intent.
3.  **Gematric Conversion**: Transmutes symbols into mathematical vibrations.
4.  **Sigil Nucleus**: Reduces the entire complexity into a single, potent seed-digit.

## 💾 MANIFESTATION (EXPORT)
Once the sigil is charged, bring it into physical reality:
*   **PNG**: Capture a static talisman (supports transparency).
*   **GIF**: Encode the temporal ebb (animation) into a shareable digital loop.

## 🛠️ THE RITUAL CHAMBER (SETUP)
To host this sanctuary locally:

1.  Clone the vessel:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Clebmb/Sigilarium-Web.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern Chromium-based browsing engine.
3.  *Note: To use the GIF export feature locally, you may need to serve the directory through a local server (e.g., Live Server or Python's http.server) to satisfy script security protocols.*
